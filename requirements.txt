# Notes:
# - 'datetime' is part of the Python standard library and should not be installed via pip.
#   Including it here could accidentally pull a different package (e.g., 'DateTime').
# - If 'lmstudio' is not available in PyPI for your environment, consider using the
#   'openai' package against LM Studio's local OpenAI-compatible server or use 'requests'.
